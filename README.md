# orbital_elements
A collection of classes for computing dynamics and solutions in different orbital element sets, along with functions for converting between different element sets.


There are a number of different ways to represent orbits, each with their pros and cons, and often it can be cumbersome to convert between them and perform the operations you want, so this was my attempt at making those tasks a bit easier.
